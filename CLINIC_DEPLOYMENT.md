```

## üè• Clinical Workflow Integration

### Priority Levels
- **URGENT**: Diabetes detected, immediate physician consultation required
- **MODERATE**: Pre-diabetes, lifestyle intervention recommended
- **REVIEW**: Low confidence prediction, clinical review needed
- **ROUTINE**: Normal results, routine follow-up

### Next Steps Automation
The system automatically generates:
- Clinical recommendations
- Follow-up timelines

  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Model Selection Strategy
The system automatically selects the appropriate model:

1. **Clinical Assessment** (uses DDFH model):
   - When `type: \"clinical\"` is specified
   - When `hba1c` is present in data
   - For diagnosis support in clinical settings

2. **Screening Assessment** (uses PIMA model):
   - When `type: \"screening\"` is specified  
   - When PIMA features are present (pregnancies, etc.)
   - For population health screening

3. **Auto-Detection** (uses best model for data):
   - When `type: \"auto\"` is specified
   - Automatically selects clinical or screening based on available features

### Clinical Thresholds
- **High Risk**: Clinical risk score ‚â• 80
- **Moderate Risk**: Clinical risk score ‚â• 60  
- **Low Confidence**: AI confidence < 80%
